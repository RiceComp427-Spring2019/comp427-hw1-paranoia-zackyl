## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - The football team and stadium are both in the same university
  - The football team has a lot of money since it is ranked among the best in the country 
  - The football team practices in its stadium
  - the football team plays another team in its stadium once every week
  - The stadium can fit around 60000 people
  - The stadium is sturdily built and has adequate room/entrances/exits.  
- Assets:
  - One of the biggest assets of the university stadium is the university's team. This is because the main purpose of the stadium is the facilitate the team's practice and also the team's games. The team is the main thing the stadium is used for and it is also what generates value for the stadium as it attracts spectators and revenue through tickets/merchandise sales. 
  - The stadium itself is also a major asset. Stadiums are very big and cost a lot of money to build and maintain and are absolutely necessary for the team so it is also a huge asset. 
  - Another asset is the audience who come to watch the matches, since they provide the revenue for the team and also generate hype, excitement, and morale. 
- Threats:
  - One threat might might be a targeted attack by a malicious outsider. This might be a highly planned attack by an enemy team or someone who doesn't like the team. One mode of attack would be to try to directly damage the stadium. They might try to sneak in at night to break parts of the stadium or even during the matches. They might also try to attack the players to physically damage the team members. Again, they could do that by attacking the players during transit to the stadium or while they are actually in the stadium.
  - Another threat include accidental damage, especially during matches. Since the stadium could receive a lot of stress from the large amount of people who usually attend games, players can accidentally break things like benches, rails, seats, etc. There could even be risk of core structural damage and even the whole stadium breaking. 
  - Another threat is the spectators getting damaged in brawls, or from the stadium itself. 
  - There is also the threat of the employees themselves backstabbing the team or otherwise having unprofessional behavior. 
- Countermeasures:
  - To prevent against planned attacks when the stadium is not being used, we could hire guards and maintenance people to make sure there are no open entrances or possible points of entry when we don't want people to enter and that there are no weak points in the defenses. We could even hire a few hire guards to physically patrol to the place if we deem the risk of sabotage is high enough and worth the money. The guard could scan for people entering or otherwise doing things that could harm the stadium. If the risk was high enough, we could even hire multiple guards and developing varying patrol patterns to make sure it was impossible to learn the patterns of the guards. To prevent damage during the game, we could again hire guards to patrol the place to make sure no one was causing trouble. We should also make sure that the spectator area and player area are clearly marked and again have guards make sure of everyone who gets in and out and don't let any outsiders get close to the player area.
  - To prevent against accidental damage, we could again hire maintenance people to make sure all the items were structurally sound and replace any old pieces of the stadium that are falling apart. We can also have the same patrol people looking for people causing ruckus or fighting to both prevent accidental injury to people and the stadium.
  - We should also make sure there are no dangerous parts of the stadium such as splinters, sharp corners, or otherwise anything that could potentially be used as a weapon against people or accidentally hurt people. 
  - We can also control the flow of people in and out of the stadium to make sure people don't trample each other or cause too much stress to one part of the stadium. 
  - We should have thorough background checks on the employees to make sure they are dependable people and keep a review system to make sure everyone is doing their job properly. 

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Documents}
- Assumptions:
  - Assume that the documents we are in charge of are important so it's worth spending a lot of resources to keep them safe
  - Assume that the documents we wish to store have all been scanned electronically, so document security is mostly a matter of keeping the database secure. 
- Assets:
  - The assets include the documents and the information they include. Since this is a law firm and the documents contain sensitive information, it would be potentially disastrous if some of the documents went missing or were discovered by outsiders. 
  -  Another asset is the trust of the people using the database, which could be lost at any breach of data. 
- Threats:
  - A possible threat is a database failure that could potentially wipe out a lot of the information stored in the documents. This would be made in terms of information loss. 
  - Another threat is accidental leakage of information to outsiders, either via hacking the databases or because of people informing outsiders.
  - Another threat includes intentional attack to bring down the servers or damage the integrity of the data. 
- Countermeasures:
  - A counter measure to prevent database failure is to use a secure system that has some level of added security with the ability to recover lost information. This can include using RAID6 or a more sophisticated method to reduce the chances of the database ever failing. We should constantly try to keep the servers up and running and consistent by hiring DB engineers or at least some basic maintenance people. 
  - To prevent the accidental leakage of information, we could try encrypting the database, and having a secure validation system that only grants access to data to people who have been cleared to have access to it. We could also give people limited access to the data, i.e. don't allow people to download information unless granted special permissions, and checking to make sure that no information leaves the company. We could also talk to other departments such as HR or some other security group to help enforce a culture that values data integrity/confidentiality within the company employees and set up severe punishment for violations of the above. 
  - To prevent against intentional attacks, we could set up severs in well secured/guarded areas to prevent unauthorized access to the servers. We could also use some type of encryption technique/validation technique as mentioned above. 

## Problem 3
- Scenario: president traveling 
- Assumptions:
  - There are significant enough threats to warrant high security measures
  - There is a large budget to work with
  - The president has a lot of resources and trained professionals helping him 
- Assets:
  - The president's health since he could be injured or targeted by someone.
  - Peace of mind of the president. If the president is not safe, he will not have peace of mind and it could affect his decision making process. 
  - Stability of the nation. If the president is not safe it could make others worried. Furthermore, if the president is seriously injured or killed, it might cause chaos and turmoil since people that will cause quite a big abrupt change in leadership that people aren't used to.
- Threats:
  - There could be accidents such as natural disasters, road issues, or other construction problems that endanger the president.
  - There could be targeted attacks against the president by terrorists or crazy people.
  - The president could put himself in danger by doing risky activities. 
- Countermeasures:
  - to prevent against accidents, we could carefully inspect all equipment used for travel including cars, airplanes, etc. We can also make sure we only use well-maintained roads that are likely to be safe and secure and have low chances of breaking down. We would also keep an eye out for weather patterns and avoid any areas prone to natural disasters.
  - To prevent against targeted attacks, we could hire a lot of defenses to like guards and bullet-proof vehicles to physically protect the president. They can also use a lot of identical vehicles to distract enemies so they do not know which vehicle the president is in. We can also pre-scan the selected route to make reduce the chance of threats before departing on the trip. They can also restrict access to the route so the president can travel more smoothly and further reduce the chance of threats. 
  - to prevent the president from endangering himself, i.e. taking too long to get in the car, accidentally hurting himself on a security tool or something dumb like that, we could coach the president on the security protocol to make sure that he doesn't put his on safety in danger.
