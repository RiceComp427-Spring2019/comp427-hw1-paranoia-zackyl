## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - The football team and stadium are both in the same university
  - The football team has a lot of money since it is ranked among the best in the country 
  - The football team practices in its stadium
  - the football team plays another team in its stadium once every week
  - The stadium can fit around 60000 people
  - The stadium is sturdily built and has adequate room/entrances/exits.  
- Assets:
  - One of the biggest assets of the university stadium is the university's team. This is because the main purpose of the stadium is the facilitate the team's practice and also the team's games. The team is the main thing the stadium is used for and it is also what generates value for the stadium as it attracts spectators and revenue through tickets/merchandise sales. 
  - The stadium itself is also a major asset. Stadiums are very big and cost a lot of money to build and maintain and are absolutely necessary for the team so it is also a huge asset. 
  - Another asset is the audience who come to watch the matches, since they provide the revenue for the team and also generate hype, excitement, and morale. 
- Threats:
  - One threat might might be a targeted attack by a malicious outsider. This might be a highly planned attack by an enemy team or someone who doesn't like the team. One mode of attack would be to try to directly damage the stadium. They might try to sneak in at night to break parts of the stadium or even during the matches. They might also try to attack the players to physically damage the team members. Again, they could do that by attacking the players during transit to the stadium or while they are actually in the stadium.
  - Another threat include accidental damage, especially during matches. Since the stadium could receive a lot of stress from the large amount of people who usually attend games, players can accidentally break things like benches, rails, seats, etc. There could even be risk of core structural damage and even the whole stadium breaking. 
  - Another threat is the spectators getting damaged in brawls, or from the stadium itself. 
  - There is also the threat of the employees themselves backstabbing the team or otherwise having unprofessional behavior. 
- Countermeasures:
  - To prevent against planned attacks when the stadium is not being used, we could hire guards and maintenance people to make sure there are no open entrances or possible points of entry when we don't want people to enter and that there are no weak points in the defenses. We could even hire a few hire guards to physically patrol to the place if we deem the risk of sabotage is high enough and worth the money. The guard could scan for people entering or otherwise doing things that could harm the stadium. If the risk was high enough, we could even hire multiple guards and developing varying patrol patterns to make sure it was impossible to learn the patterns of the guards. To prevent damage during the game, we could again hire guards to patrol the place to make sure no one was causing trouble. We should also make sure that the spectator area and player area are clearly marked and again have guards make sure of everyone who gets in and out and don't let any outsiders get close to the player area.
  - To prevent against accidental damage, we could again hire maintenance people to make sure all the items were structurally sound and replace any old pieces of the stadium that are falling apart. We can also have the same patrol people looking for people causing ruckus or fighting to both prevent accidental injury to people and the stadium.
  - We should also make sure there are no dangerous parts of the stadium such as splinters, sharp corners, or otherwise anything that could potentially be used as a weapon against people or accidentally hurt people. 
  - We can also control the flow of people in and out of the stadium to make sure people don't trample each other or cause too much stress to one part of the stadium. 
  - We should have thorough background checks on the employees to make sure they are dependable people and keep a review system to make sure everyone is doing their job properly.
